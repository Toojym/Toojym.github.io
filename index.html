								<h2 class="major">Work</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Throughout my academic journey and personal projects, I have worked on various software development tasks that showcase my skills and creativity. I have designed and developed user interface for a website using figma. As well as  using languages such as C++ and Lua focusing on user-friendly interfaces and efficient backend solutions. One of my notable projects includes building a functional main menu user interface on roblox studio. This experience taught me the importance of effective system architecture in achieving project goals.</p>
								<p>Additionally, I have contributed to open-source projects on GitHub, where I collaborated with developers in campus to solve real-world problems. These experiences have strengthened my ability to write clean, maintainable code while learning from industry professionals. My work reflects a passion for continuous improvement and a commitment to creating innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>

							<p>Here are my reflections on the work I did for my TIS course!</p>
							<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
							<h4>[Poster for Industrial talk I]</h4>
							<p>My team and I, were tasked with creating a poster for AirAsia based on a webinar made by UTM's Faculty of Computing. Working on the poster to summarize this was a team effort that boosted my teamwork, info analysis, and design skills. This experience showed me how key IT is for innovation and stressed the importance of both technical and soft skills for job readiness. Overall, the webinar and the poster project were not just informative, but also inspiring, pushing me to look into real-world tech applications more. </p>
							
							<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
							<h4>[Video for Industrial visit I]</h4>
							<p>Creating the video about our visit to UTMDigital was eye-opening. Collaborating with my peers on this project improved my teamwork and project management skills. During the visit, we saw how UTMDigital integrates advanced technologies into their operations, which broadened my perspective on the industry. The hands-on experience of editing the video taught me a lot about effective communication and storytelling.</p>

							<p>We also attended a seminar at UTMDigital, where experts shared insights on the latest industry trends and innovations. This seminar was incredibly informative and further deepened my appreciation for digital transformation in modern industries.</p>
								
							<p>Overall, the assignment was both inspiring and motivating, reinforcing my excitement to explore technological advancements and their applications.</p>

							<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
							<h4>[Academic Writing for Industrial Talk II]</h4>
							<p>This assignment, focusing on required skills in university and industry, was highly informative. Nik Muhammad Habibullah bin Mohd Nizam, a UTM alumni, shared his journey through entrepreneurial ventures and emphasized leveraging real-world experiences to develop innovative solutions.</p>
							<p>Key skills explored included technical proficiency (like programming languages and software development methodologies), problem-solving abilities, continuous learning, and effective communication. In the industry context, essential skills mentioned included adaptability to evolving technologies, teamwork and leadership, and proficiency with industry-specific tools.</p>
							<p>This assignment not only provided a deeper understanding of key skills needed in both academic and professional settings but also inspired us to pursue further growth and opportunities in the tech field.</p>
							
							<h3>Assignment 4</h3>
							<h4>[Technology Information System and Industrial Visit]</h4>
							<p>Creating the newsletter about our visit to <b>MAG<span style="color:  purple;">ICX</span></b> UTM was an enriching experience. The process began with a detailed observation of various advanced technologies showcased at the center. We saw virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) being applied in industries like healthcare and education, which broadened my perspective on their potential impacts. Capturing these insights and translating them into an engaging newsletter was both challenging and rewarding.</p>
							<p>Working on the newsletter improved my information analysis and design skills. We discussed technological challenges and opportunities, such as user experience design and ethical considerations, making sure to present this information clearly and concisely in the newsletter. The effort of summarizing these insights in a reader-friendly format polished my writing and communication abilities.</p>
							<p>Reflecting on the overall experience, creating the newsletter not only solidified my understanding of emerging technologies but also emphasized the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in the tech industry. It reinforced the value of hands-on learning and motivated me to explore innovative solutions in future projects. The process was not just about producing a newsletter but also developing critical skills needed for success in the fast-evolving tech landscape.</p>
